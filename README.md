# adwshell

## The Idea

I really want to use [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri).

To use it, I also need to install a bar/shell.  
Then an application launcher.  
Then a notification daemon.  
Then spend hours configuring them.  
Then even more time styling it all.

That is an enormous amount of friction, and even after all of that, the experience still feels too loose.
This is what I want `adwshell` to solve. No infinite configuration, just sane defaults, and a few options here and
there. Style provided by your system's GTK theme, with an additional stylesheet if you need specific tweaks. That's it.
Maybe extension support at some point.

## The Present

Not usable for anything yet.
This is my first project written in Rust, so things will be rough for a while.
